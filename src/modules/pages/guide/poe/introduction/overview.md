# Overview

Poe is an idea. Poe is a way of building applications that can scale (in terms performance and maintenence) while promoting speed of development. It is ever-evolving; always seeking ways to improve.

The name refers to the poet/critic, Edgar Allan Poe, who was known as "the most discriminating, philosophical, and fearless critic upon imaginative works who has written in America." We desire to follow in this same light as we build and create products.

Poe is comprimised of several components. These can be used in isolation but work best when used together. The driving principle here is "optimize for regret"; change is inevitable. Those who can adapt, will survive. All components of Poe should embrace change as a natural (and exciting) aspect of software.

These components include:

* [Poe-UI](/guide/ui/introduction/overview)
* [Poe-API](/guide/api/introduction/overview)
* [Poe-CLI](/guide/cli/introduction/overview)
